# Thrift
Thrift is a money-tracking web application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Users will be able to track their transactions, accounts, and the institutions that they belong too. Stretch goals will include adding budgeting tools, implementing a charting library, and connecting to Plaid's API (an API that connects your account to your real-time banking information).

* View all of my banks, accounts, and transactions
* View details of each individual bank, account, and transaction
* Create new banks, accounts, and transactions
* Update my current banks, accounts, and transactions
* Delete my current banks, accounts, and transactions

## Stretch Goals
* Add user auth
* Add custom categories and sub-categories
* Add ability to create budgets and set spending limits for categories
* Implement a charting library to better view data
* Connect to Plaid API to auto-update transactions
